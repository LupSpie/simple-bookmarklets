# Simple Bookmarklets

These are some [bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) that I've made. They should work on every browser; *please note that I've only tested them on a chromium based one*. Also, if you want to check out the code in a readable format, just head on to the [readable_code](./readable_code) folder.

[Click here](./bookmarklets.md) to check out the bookmarklets.

## How to "install"

### On every browser:

1. Copy the desired bookmarklet
2. Head to your bookmark bar
3. Right click to add a new bookmark
4. Copy and paste to the address field
5. Now you just need to click the bookmark to activate the bookmarklet

### On Vivaldi (command chains):

Since 4.1 the Vivaldi browser supports command chains (they can also run JavaScript inside them).

1. Copy the desired bookmarklet
2. Head to the settings page
3. Go to the Quick Commands
4. Create a new chain
5. Change the command to Open Link in Current Tab
6. Copy and paste to the Command Parameter
