# Simple Bookmarklets

These are some of the [bookmarklets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) I've made. They sould work on every browser, or at least every browser that runs on chromium.

Checkout the [readable_code](./readable_code/) folder if you want to understand what the fuck is happening (maybe even make it better lol)

\**Just note that I've only tested them on the Vivaldi Browser. So I don't know if they'll work 101% on every browser* <br />
I hope they can help you in some way ðŸ™‚

### How to "install"

The code is in the [bookmarklets.md](./bookmarklets.md) file, all you need to do is Copy and Paste them following these instructions:

**On every browser:**

1. Head to your bookmark bar
2. Right click to add a new bookmark
3. Copy and paste the `javascript:()` to the address field
4. Now you just need to click the bookmark to activate the bookmarklet

**On Vivaldi (command chains):**

Since 4.1 Vivaldi supports command chains, and they can also run bookmarklets. Here's how:

1. Head to the settings page
2. Go to the Quick Commands
3. Create a new chain
4. Change the command to Open Link in Current Tab
5. Copy and paste the `javascript:()` to the Command Parameter
6. Done, now you can use the bookmarklet in context menus, mouse gestures, keyboard shortcuts or in the quick commands.
